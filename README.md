# Sforecast

Automation script that helps me in the task of interpreting when there are waves, scraping data from multiple sites (with threads), spots data from surf-forecast and the one from rising and falling tides.

# steps to put this to work:

Asure you have selenium and google chrome installed on your linux machine.

1. ```git clone this repo```
2. ```cd to folder```
3. ```python -m venv venv```
4. ```source venv/bin/activate```
3. ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
4. ```asure you downloaded google chrome and chromedriver, and chromedriver its on path```
5. ```python surf_main.py```

At the end, it will generate a text file (forecast.csv), where you can see all the conditions.
